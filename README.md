# My own Arduino FM Radio Receiver 

Hello good day everyone! Here is my full fledged Arduino FM commercial radio receiver! It makes use of the TEA5767 module to receive radio signals. Additionally I also added a 4 digit 7 segment led display to show the frequency being used and 3 LEDs to indicate the strength of the signal.

PS: The "conn" component you see there is where the module itself is located. I just couldn't find a way to add it to kicad so I did that instead.
